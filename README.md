# Image-Processing-Web-App
Development of simple Image Processing web app using streamlt 

Streamlit is powerful and yet simple platform to develop a python-based apps. In this project streamlit has been used to create image processing app with OpenCV library.  In OpenCV library multiple algorithms and function are available to perform certain task, for example any image can be resized, cropped, format, pasting or overlapping of two images, rotating, flipping, drawing, color transformations etc. can be done with simple line of code. In this app, several image processing methods such as edge detection, blur, morphological transformations, corner detections etc. have been considered. More details of OpenCV and streamlit can be found in the official website. Screenshots of web app for image processing are depicted in figure 1 to 4.
